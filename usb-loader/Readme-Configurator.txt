*** Configurator for Configurable USB Loader ***

The zip file for Configurator contains the following files:
- CfgLoaderConfigurator.exe    (The application itself)
- ConfiguratorHelp.chm         (Help documentation)
- Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll        (DotNetZip unzip library)
- Readme.txt                   (This file)

To use this application, extract CfgLoaderConfigurator.exe and 
Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll to any directory on your computer and 
double-click CfgLoaderConfigurator.exe.  Note: You only need 
to copy the .dll if you wish to use the Configurator's online 
self-update feature.

Things will be even easier if you place your files into the base 
directory of Configurable USB Loader (typically sd:/usb-loader).  
By doing this, the loader will detect the config.txt and other 
needed files as it starts up.

If you have translation files (a group of files ending in .cdb), 
add those to the same directory as CfgLoaderConfigurator.exe and 
they will also be utilised during startup.
